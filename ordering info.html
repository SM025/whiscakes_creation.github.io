                        <p>Custom cakes start at P 450.00, for a round 4" (serves 4) with a simple custom design. Tiered Cakes will start at $85.00 to serve 25 people. Decorations and custom designs will be subject to additional cost, and are priced by the amount of time that the decor takes for our talented staff to make. Upcharges for design are based on a cake by cake basis.</p>
