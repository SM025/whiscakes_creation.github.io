                    <p>At Whiscakes Creation, we make all of our cakes, buttercream, fondant and decorations from scratch. That means we’re baking them when you order them. We only use fresh ingredients, including real butter, milk, flour, sugar and eggs! The fondant we use is a little tough and soft and has the consistency of a marshmallow. We always assure that our cake is not too shaky to eat or too sweet.

                        <br><br>This means our cakes not only look beautiful, but they also taste delicious </p>
